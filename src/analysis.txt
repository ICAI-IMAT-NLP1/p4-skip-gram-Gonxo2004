In the obtained image, we can observe the results of the word embeddings. As we have seen, words with similar 
meanings should appear reasonably close together, while those with opposite meanings should be very far apart.
Although most words, especially in the central part of the image, are illegible, several similarities can be 
distinguished, verifying the correct functioning of the model. For example, around the point (-4, 2.5), we 
find three words with almost identical embeddings (profit, amount, free), which makes a lot of sense. Another 
example can be found at the point (2, 2.5) with (ideas, theory, belief) notably close to each other.
We also find several examples of word pairs in their singular and plural forms or even with different spelling
variations. These include (law, laws), (labor, labour), and (organization, organisation).
Finally, it can also be observed that words with distant embeddings have very different meanings. For instance,
(anthropologists, sans) appear at opposite extremes of the y-axis.
